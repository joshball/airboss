# Traffic Information Service (TIS)

a. Introduction.
The Traffic Information Service (TIS) provides
information to the cockpit via data link, that is similar
to VFR radar traffic advisories normally received
over voice radio. Among the first FAA-provided data
services, TIS is intended to improve the safety and
efficiency of “see and avoid” flight through an
automatic display that informs the pilot of nearby
traffic and potential conflict situations. This traffic
display is intended to assist the pilot in visual
acquisition of these aircraft. TIS employs an
enhanced capability of the terminal Mode S radar
system, which contains the surveillance data, as well
as the data link required to “uplink” this information
to suitably-equipped aircraft (known as a TIS
“client”). TIS provides estimated position, altitude,
altitude trend, and ground track information for up to
8 intruder aircraft within 7 NM horizontally,
+3,500 and -3,000 feet vertically of the client aircraft
(see FIG 4-5-4, TIS Proximity Coverage Volume).
The range of a target reported at a distance greater
than 7 NM only indicates that this target will be a
threat within 34 seconds and does not display an
precise distance. TIS will alert the pilot to aircraft
(under surveillance of the Mode S radar) that are
estimated to be within 34 seconds of potential
collision, regardless of distance of altitude. TIS
surveillance data is derived from the same radar used
by ATC; this data is uplinked to the client aircraft on
each radar scan (nominally every 5 seconds).

b. Requirements.
1. In order to use TIS, the client and any intruder
aircraft must be equipped with the appropriate
cockpit equipment and fly within the radar coverage
of a Mode S radar capable of providing TIS.

Typically, this will be within 55 NM of the sites
depicted in FIG 4-5-5, Terminal Mode S Radar Sites.
ATC communication is not a requirement to receive
TIS, although it may be required by the particular
airspace or flight operations in which TIS is being
used.

2. The cockpit equipment functionality required
by a TIS client aircraft to receive the service consists
of the following (refer to FIG 4-5-6):
(a) Mode S data link transponder with
altitude encoder.
(b) Data link applications processor with TIS
software installed.
(c) Control-display unit.
(d) Optional equipment includes a digital
heading source to correct display errors caused by
“crab angle” and turning maneuvers.
NOTE-
Some of the above functions will likely be combined into
single pieces of avionics, such as (a) and (b).

3. To be visible to the TIS client, the intruder
aircraft must, at a minimum, have an operating
transponder (Mode A, C or S). All altitude
information provided by TIS from intruder aircraft is
derived from Mode C reports, if appropriately
equipped.
4. TIS will initially be provided by the terminal
Mode S systems that are paired with ASR-9 digital
primary radars. These systems are in locations with
the greatest traffic densities, thus will provide the
greatest initial benefit. The remaining terminal
Mode S sensors, which are paired with ASR-7 or
ASR-8 analog primary radars, will provide TIS
pending modification or relocation of these sites. See
FIG 4-5-5, Terminal Mode S Radar Sites, for site
locations. There is no mechanism in place, such as
NOTAMs, to provide status update on individual
radar sites since TIS is a nonessential, supplemental
information service.
The FAA also operates en route Mode S radars (not
illustrated) that rotate once every 12 seconds. These
sites will require additional development of TIS
before any possible implementation. There are no
plans to implement TIS in the en route Mode S radars
at the present time.
c. Capabilities.
1. TIS provides ground-based surveillance
information over the Mode S data link to properly
equipped client aircraft to aid in visual acquisition of
proximate air traffic. The actual avionics capability of
each installation will vary and the supplemental
handbook material must be consulted prior to using

Surveillance Systems


TIS. A maximum of eight (8) intruder aircraft may be
displayed; if more than eight aircraft match intruder
parameters, the eight “most significant” intruders are
uplinked. These “most significant” intruders are
usually the ones in closest proximity and/or the
greatest threat to the TIS client.
2. TIS, through the Mode S ground sensor,
provides the following data on each intruder aircraft:
(a) Relative bearing information in 6-degree
increments.
(b) Relative range information in 1/8 NM to
1 NM increments (depending on range).
(c) Relative altitude in 100-foot increments
(within 1,000 feet) or 500-foot increments (from
1,000-3,500 feet) if the intruder aircraft has operating
altitude reporting capability.
(d) Estimated intruder ground track in
45-degree increments.
(e) Altitude trend data (level within 500 fpm
or climbing/descending >500 fpm) if the intruder
aircraft has operating altitude reporting capability.
(f) Intruder priority as either an “traffic
advisory” or “proximate” intruder.
3. When flying from surveillance coverage of
one Mode S sensor to another, the transfer of TIS is
an automatic function of the avionics system and
requires no action from the pilot.
4. There are a variety of status messages that are
provided by either the airborne system or ground
equipment to alert the pilot of high priority intruders
and data link system status. These messages include
the following:
(a) Alert. Identifies a potential collision
hazard within 34 seconds. This alert may be visual
and/or audible, such as a flashing display symbol or
a headset tone. A target is a threat if the time to the
closest approach in vertical and horizontal coordinates is less than 30 seconds and the closest approach
is expected to be within 500 feet vertically and
0.5 nautical miles laterally.
(b) TIS Traffic. TIS traffic data is displayed.
(c) Coasting. The TIS display is more than
6 seconds old. This indicates a missing uplink from
the ground system. When the TIS display information
is more than 12 seconds old, the “No Traffic” status
will be indicated.

4-5-11

(d) No Traffic. No intruders meet proximate
or alert criteria. This condition may exist when the
TIS system is fully functional or may indicate
“coasting” between 12 and 59 seconds old (see (c)
above).
(e) TIS Unavailable. The pilot has requested TIS, but no ground system is available. This
condition will also be displayed when TIS uplinks are
missing for 60 seconds or more.
(f) TIS Disabled. The pilot has not requested
TIS or has disconnected from TIS.
(g) Good-bye. The client aircraft has flown
outside of TIS coverage.
NOTE-
Depending on the avionics manufacturer implementation,
it is possible that some of these messages will not be directly
available to the pilot.

5. Depending on avionics system design, TIS
may be presented to the pilot in a variety of different
displays, including text and/or graphics. Voice
annunciation may also be used, either alone or in
combination with a visual display. FIG 4-5-6,
Traffic Information Service (TIS), Avionics Block
Diagram, shows an example of a TIS display using
symbology similar to the Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System (TCAS) installed on most
passenger air carrier/commuter aircraft in the U.S.
The small symbol in the center represents the client
aircraft and the display is oriented “track up,” with the
12 o’clock position at the top. The range rings
indicate 2 and 5 NM. Each intruder is depicted by a
symbol positioned at the approximate relative
bearing and range from the client aircraft. The
circular symbol near the center indicates an “alert”
intruder and the diamond symbols indicate “proximate” intruders.
6. The inset in the lower right corner of
FIG 4-5-6, Traffic Information Service (TIS),
Avionics Block Diagram, shows a possible TIS data
block display. The following information is contained in this data block:
(a) The intruder, located approximately
four o’clock, three miles, is a “proximate” aircraft
and currently not a collision threat to the client
aircraft. This is indicated by the diamond symbol
used in this example.

4-5-12


(b) The intruder ground track diverges to the
right of the client aircraft, indicated by the small
arrow.
(c) The intruder altitude is 700 feet less than
or below the client aircraft, indicated by the “-07”
located under the symbol.
(d) The intruder is descending >500 fpm,
indicated by the downward arrow next to the “-07”
relative altitude information. The absence of this
arrow when an altitude tag is present indicates level
flight or a climb/descent rate less than 500 fpm.
NOTE-
If the intruder did not have an operating altitude encoder
(Mode C), the altitude and altitude trend “tags” would
have been omitted.

d. Limitations.
1. TIS is NOT intended to be used as a collision
avoidance system and does not relieve the pilot
responsibility to “see and avoid” other aircraft (see
paragraph 5-5-8, See and Avoid). TIS must not be for
avoidance maneuvers during IMC or other times
when there is no visual contact with the intruder
aircraft. TIS is intended only to assist in visual
acquisition of other aircraft in VMC. No recommended avoidance maneuvers are provided for,
nor authorized, as a direct result of a TIS intruder
display or TIS alert.
2. While TIS is a useful aid to visual traffic
avoidance, it has some system limitations that must
be fully understood to ensure proper use. Many of
these limitations are inherent in secondary radar
surveillance. In other words, the information
provided by TIS will be no better than that provided
to ATC. Other limitations and anomalies are
associated with the TIS predictive algorithm.
(a) Intruder Display Limitations. TIS will
only display aircraft with operating transponders
installed. TIS relies on surveillance of the Mode S
radar, which is a “secondary surveillance” radar
similar to the ATCRBS described in paragraph 4-5-2.
(b) TIS Client Altitude Reporting Requirement. Altitude reporting is required by the TIS client
aircraft in order to receive TIS. If the altitude encoder
is inoperative or disabled, TIS will be unavailable, as
TIS requests will not be honored by the ground
system. As such, TIS requires altitude reporting to
determine the Proximity Coverage Volume as

Surveillance Systems

indicated in FIG 4-5-4. TIS users must be alert to
altitude encoder malfunctions, as TIS has no
mechanism to determine if client altitude reporting is
correct. A failure of this nature will cause erroneous
and possibly unpredictable TIS operation. If this
malfunction is suspected, confirmation of altitude
reporting with ATC is suggested.
(c) Intruder Altitude Reporting. Intruders
without altitude reporting capability will be displayed without the accompanying altitude tag.
Additionally, nonaltitude reporting intruders are
assumed to be at the same altitude as the TIS client for
alert computations. This helps to ensure that the pilot
will be alerted to all traffic under radar coverage, but
the actual altitude difference may be substantial.
Therefore, visual acquisition may be difficult in this
instance.
(d) Coverage Limitations. Since TIS is
provided by ground-based, secondary surveillance
radar, it is subject to all limitations of that radar. If an
aircraft is not detected by the radar, it cannot be
displayed on TIS. Examples of these limitations are
as follows:
(1) TIS will typically be provided within
55 NM of the radars depicted in FIG 4-5-5, Terminal
Mode S Radar Sites. This maximum range can vary
by radar site and is always subject to “line of sight”
limitations; the radar and data link signals will be
blocked by obstructions, terrain, and curvature of the
earth.
(2) TIS will be unavailable at low altitudes
in many areas of the country, particularly in
mountainous regions. Also, when flying near the
“floor” of radar coverage in a particular area,
intruders below the client aircraft may not be detected
by TIS.
(3) TIS will be temporarily disrupted when
flying directly over the radar site providing coverage
if no adjacent site assumes the service. A
ground-based radar, like a VOR or NDB, has a zenith
cone, sometimes referred to as the cone of confusion
or cone of silence. This is the area of ambiguity
directly above the station where bearing information
is unreliable. The zenith cone setting for TIS is
34 degrees: Any aircraft above that angle with
respect to the radar horizon will lose TIS coverage
from that radar until it is below this 34 degree angle.
The aircraft may not actually lose service in areas of

Surveillance Systems


multiple radar coverage since an adjacent radar will
provide TIS. If no other TIS-capable radar is
available, the “Good-bye” message will be received
and TIS terminated until coverage is resumed.
(e) Intermittent Operations. TIS operation
may be intermittent during turns or other maneuvering, particularly if the transponder system does not
include antenna diversity (antenna mounted on the
top and bottom of the aircraft). As in (d) above, TIS
is dependent on two-way, “line of sight” communications between the aircraft and the Mode S radar.
Whenever the structure of the client aircraft comes
between the transponder antenna (usually located on
the underside of the aircraft) and the ground-based
radar antenna, the signal may be temporarily
interrupted.
(f) TIS Predictive Algorithm. TIS information is collected one radar scan prior to the scan
during which the uplink occurs. Therefore, the
surveillance information is approximately 5 seconds
old. In order to present the intruders in a “real time”
position, TIS uses a “predictive algorithm” in its
tracking software. This algorithm uses track history
data to extrapolate intruders to their expected
positions consistent with the time of display in the
cockpit. Occasionally, aircraft maneuvering will
cause this algorithm to induce errors in the TIS
display. These errors primarily affect relative bearing
information; intruder distance and altitude will
remain relatively accurate and may be used to assist
in “see and avoid.” Some of the more common
examples of these errors are as follows:
(1) When client or intruder aircraft maneuver excessively or abruptly, the tracking algorithm
will report incorrect horizontal position until the
maneuvering aircraft stabilizes.
(2) When a rapidly closing intruder is on a
course that crosses the client at a shallow angle (either
overtaking or head on) and either aircraft abruptly
changes course within ¼ NM, TIS will display the
intruder on the opposite side of the client than it
actually is.
These are relatively rare occurrences and will be
corrected in a few radar scans once the course has
stabilized.
(g) Heading/Course Reference. Not all TIS
aircraft installations will have onboard heading
reference information. In these installations, aircraft
course reference to the TIS display is provided by the

4-5-13

Mode S radar. The radar only determines ground
track information and has no indication of the client
aircraft heading. In these installations, all intruder
bearing information is referenced to ground track and
does not account for wind correction. Additionally,
since ground-based radar will require several scans
to determine aircraft course following a course
change, a lag in TIS display orientation (intruder
aircraft bearing) will occur. As in (f) above, intruder
distance and altitude are still usable.
(h) Closely-Spaced Intruder Errors.
When operating more than 30 NM from the Mode S
sensor, TIS forces any intruder within 3/8 NM of the
TIS client to appear at the same horizontal position as
the client aircraft. Without this feature, TIS could
display intruders in a manner confusing to the pilot in
critical situations (e.g., a closely-spaced intruder that
is actually to the right of the client may appear on the
TIS display to the left). At longer distances from the
radar, TIS cannot accurately determine relative
bearing/distance information on intruder aircraft that
are in close proximity to the client.
Because TIS uses a ground-based, rotating radar for
surveillance information, the accuracy of TIS data is
dependent on the distance from the sensor (radar)
providing the service. This is much the same
phenomenon as experienced with ground-based
navigational aids, such as VOR or NDB. As distance
from the radar increases, the accuracy of surveillance
decreases. Since TIS does not inform the pilot of
distance from the Mode S radar, the pilot must assume
that any intruder appearing at the same position as the
client aircraft may actually be up to 3/8 NM away in
any direction. Consistent with the operation of TIS,
an alert on the display (regardless of distance from the
radar) should stimulate an outside visual scan,
intruder acquisition, and traffic avoidance based on
outside reference.
e. Reports of TIS Malfunctions.
1. Users of TIS can render valuable assistance in
the early correction of malfunctions by reporting their
observations of undesirable performance. Reporters
should identify the time of observation, location, type
and identity of aircraft, and describe the condition
observed; the type of transponder processor, and
software in use can also be useful information. Since
TIS performance is monitored by maintenance
personnel rather than ATC, it is suggested that

4-5-14


malfunctions be reported by radio or telephone to the
nearest Flight Service Station (FSS) facility.
