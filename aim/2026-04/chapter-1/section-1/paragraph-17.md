# Global Positioning System (GPS)

a. System Overview
1. System Description. The Global Positioning
System is a space-based radio navigation system
used to determine precise position anywhere in the
world. The 24 satellite constellation is designed to
ensure at least five satellites are always visible to a
user worldwide. A minimum of four satellites is
necessary for receivers to establish an accurate
three-dimensional position. The receiver uses data
from satellites above the mask angle (the lowest
angle above the horizon at which a receiver can use
a satellite). The Department of Defense (DOD) is
responsible for operating the GPS satellite constellation and monitors the GPS satellites to ensure proper
operation. Each satellite’s orbital parameters (ephemeris data) are sent to each satellite for broadcast as

Navigation Aids

part of the data message embedded in the GPS signal.
The GPS coordinate system is the Cartesian
earth-centered, earth-fixed coordinates as specified
in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
2. System Availability and Reliability.
(a) The status of GPS satellites is broadcast as
part of the data message transmitted by the GPS
satellites. GPS status information is also available by
means of the U.S. Coast Guard navigation
information service: (703) 313-5907, Internet:
http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/. Additionally, satellite status is available through the Notice to Airmen
(NOTAM) system.
(b) GNSS operational status depends on the
type of equipment being used. For GPS-only
equipment TSO-C129 or TSO-C196(), the operational status of non-precision approach capability for
flight planning purposes is provided through a
prediction program that is embedded in the receiver
or provided separately.
3. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring
(RAIM). RAIM is the capability of a GPS receiver to
perform integrity monitoring on itself by ensuring
available satellite signals meet the integrity requirements for a given phase of flight. Without RAIM, the
pilot has no assurance of the GPS position integrity.
RAIM provides immediate feedback to the pilot. This
fault detection is critical for performance-based
navigation (PBN)(see Paragraph 1-2-1, Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) and Area Navigation
(RNAV), for an introduction to PBN), because delays
of up to two hours can occur before an erroneous
satellite transmission is detected and corrected by the
satellite control segment.
(a) In order for RAIM to determine if a
satellite is providing corrupted information, at least
one satellite, in addition to those required for
navigation, must be in view for the receiver to
perform the RAIM function. RAIM requires a
minimum of 5 satellites, or 4 satellites and barometric
altimeter input (baro-aiding), to detect an integrity
anomaly. Baro-aiding is a method of augmenting the
GPS integrity solution by using a non-satellite input
source in lieu of the fifth satellite. Some GPS
receivers also have a RAIM capability, called fault
detection and exclusion (FDE), that excludes a failed
satellite from the position solution; GPS receivers
capable of FDE require 6 satellites or 5 satellites with

Navigation Aids


baro-aiding. This allows the GPS receiver to isolate
the corrupt satellite signal, remove it from the
position solution, and still provide an integrity-assured position. To ensure that baro-aiding is
available, enter the current altimeter setting into the
receiver as described in the operating manual. Do not
use the GPS derived altitude due to the large GPS
vertical errors that will make the integrity monitoring
function invalid.
(b) There are generally two types of RAIM
fault messages. The first type of message indicates
that there are not enough satellites available to
provide RAIM integrity monitoring. The GPS
navigation solution may be acceptable, but the
integrity of the solution cannot be determined. The
second type indicates that the RAIM integrity
monitor has detected a potential error and that there
is an inconsistency in the navigation solution for the
given phase of flight. Without RAIM capability, the
pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS
position.
4. Selective Availability. Selective Availability
(SA) is a method by which the accuracy of GPS is
intentionally degraded. This feature was designed to
deny hostile use of precise GPS positioning data. SA
was discontinued on May 1, 2000, but many GPS
receivers are designed to assume that SA is still
active. New receivers may take advantage of the
discontinuance of SA based on the performance
values in ICAO Annex 10.
b. Operational Use of GPS. U.S. civil operators
may use approved GPS equipment in oceanic
airspace, certain remote areas, the National Airspace
System and other States as authorized (please consult
the applicable Aeronautical Information Publication). Equipage other than GPS may be required for
the desired operation. GPS navigation is used for both
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) operations.
1. VFR Operations
(a) GPS navigation has become an asset to
VFR pilots by providing increased navigational
capabilities and enhanced situational awareness.
Although GPS has provided many benefits to the
VFR pilot, care must be exercised to ensure that
system capabilities are not exceeded. VFR pilots
should integrate GPS navigation with electronic
navigation (when possible), as well as pilotage and
dead reckoning.

1-1-17

(b) GPS receivers used for VFR navigation
vary from fully integrated IFR/VFR installation used
to support VFR operations to hand-held devices.
Pilots must understand the limitations of the receivers
prior to using in flight to avoid misusing navigation
information. (See TBL 1-1-6.) Most receivers are
not intuitive. The pilot must learn the various
keystrokes, knob functions, and displays that are
used in the operation of the receiver. Some
manufacturers provide computer-based tutorials or
simulations of their receivers that pilots can use to
become familiar with operating the equipment.
(c) When using GPS for VFR operations,
RAIM capability, database currency, and antenna
location are critical areas of concern.
(1) RAIM Capability. VFR GPS panel
mount receivers and hand-held units have no RAIM
alerting capability. This prevents the pilot from being
alerted to the loss of the required number of satellites
in view, or the detection of a position error. Pilots
should use a systematic cross-check with other
navigation techniques to verify position. Be
suspicious of the GPS position if a disagreement
exists between the two positions.
(2) Database Currency. Check the currency of the database. Databases must be updated for
IFR operations and should be updated for all other
operations. However, there is no requirement for
databases to be updated for VFR navigation. It is not
recommended to use a moving map with an outdated
database in and around critical airspace. Pilots using
an outdated database should verify waypoints using
current aeronautical products; for example, Chart
Supplement U.S., Sectional Chart, or En Route
Chart.
(3) Antenna Location. The antenna location for GPS receivers used for IFR and VFR
operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically
placed for convenience more than performance,
while IFR installations ensure a clear view is
provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing
a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the
satellite navigational signal. This is especially true
in the case of hand-held GPS receivers. Typically,
suction cups are used to place the GPS antennas on
the inside of cockpit windows. While this method has
great utility, the antenna location is limited to the
cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view
of all available satellites. Consequently, signal losses

1-1-18


may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite
signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These
losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could
present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot. While the use of a
hand-held GPS for VFR operations is not limited by
regulation, modification of the aircraft, such as
installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is
governed by 14 CFR Part 43. Consult with your
mechanic to ensure compliance with the regulation
and safe installation.
(d) Do not solely rely on GPS for VFR
navigation. No design standard of accuracy or
integrity is used for a VFR GPS receiver. VFR GPS
receivers should be used in conjunction with other
forms of navigation during VFR operations to ensure
a correct route of flight is maintained. Minimize
head-down time in the aircraft by being familiar with
your GPS receiver’s operation and by keeping eyes
outside scanning for traffic, terrain, and obstacles.
(e) VFR Waypoints
(1) VFR waypoints provide VFR pilots
with a supplementary tool to assist with position
awareness while navigating visually in aircraft
equipped with area navigation receivers. VFR
waypoints should be used as a tool to supplement
current navigation procedures. The uses of VFR
waypoints include providing navigational aids for
pilots unfamiliar with an area, waypoint definition of
existing reporting points, enhanced navigation in and
around Class B and Class C airspace, and enhanced
navigation around Special Use Airspace. VFR pilots
should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical
charts published specifically for visual navigation. If
operating in a terminal area, pilots should take
advantage of the Terminal Area Chart available for
that area, if published. The use of VFR waypoints
does not relieve the pilot of any responsibility to
comply with the operational requirements of 14 CFR
Part 91.
(2) VFR waypoint names (for computer-
entry and flight plans) consist of five letters
beginning with the letters “VP” and are retrievable
from navigation databases. The VFR waypoint
names are not intended to be pronounceable, and they
are not for use in ATC communications. On VFR
charts, stand-alone VFR waypoints will be portrayed
using the same four-point star symbol used for IFR
waypoints. VFR waypoints collocated with visual
check points on the chart will be identified by small

Navigation Aids

magenta flag symbols. VFR waypoints collocated
with visual check points will be pronounceable based
on the name of the visual check point and may be used
for ATC communications. Each VFR waypoint name
will appear in parentheses adjacent to the geographic
location on the chart. Latitude/longitude data for all
established VFR waypoints may be found in the
appropriate regional Chart Supplement U.S.
(3) VFR waypoints may not be used on IFR
flight plans. VFR waypoints are not recognized by the
IFR system and will be rejected for IFR routing
purposes.
(4) Pilots may use the five-letter identifier
as a waypoint in the route of flight section on a VFR
flight plan. Pilots may use the VFR waypoints only
when operating under VFR conditions. The point
may represent an intended course change or describe
the planned route of flight. This VFR filing would be
similar to how a VOR would be used in a route of
flight.
(5) VFR waypoints intended for use during
flight should be loaded into the receiver while on the
ground. Once airborne, pilots should avoid programming routes or VFR waypoint chains into their
receivers.
(6) Pilots should be vigilant to see and
avoid other traffic when near VFR waypoints. With
the increased use of GPS navigation and accuracy,
expect increased traffic near VFR waypoints.
Regardless of the class of airspace, monitor the
available ATC frequency for traffic information on
other aircraft operating in the vicinity. See Paragraph
7-5-2, VFR in Congested Areas, for more
information.
2. IFR Use of GPS
(a) General Requirements. Authorization
to conduct any GPS operation under IFR requires:
(1) GPS navigation equipment used for IFR
operations must be approved in accordance with the
requirements specified in Technical Standard Order
(TSO) TSO-C129(), TSO-C196(), TSO-C145(), or
TSO-C146(), and the installation must be done in
accordance with Advisory Circular AC 20-138,
Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and Navigation Systems. Equipment approved in accordance
with TSO-C115a does not meet the requirements of
TSO-C129. Visual flight rules (VFR) and hand-held

Navigation Aids


GPS systems are not authorized for IFR navigation,
instrument approaches, or as a principal instrument
flight reference.
(2) Aircraft using un-augmented GPS
(TSO-C129() or TSO-C196()) for navigation under
IFR must be equipped with an alternate approved and
operational means of navigation suitable for
navigating the proposed route of flight. (Examples of
alternate navigation equipment include VOR or
DME/DME/IRU capability). Active monitoring of
alternative navigation equipment is not required
when RAIM is available for integrity monitoring.
Active monitoring of an alternate means of
navigation is required when the GPS RAIM
capability is lost.
(3) Procedures must be established for use
in the event that the loss of RAIM capability is
predicted to occur. In situations where RAIM is
predicted to be unavailable, the flight must rely on
other approved navigation equipment, re-route to
where RAIM is available, delay departure, or cancel
the flight.
(4) The GPS operation must be conducted
in accordance with the FAA-approved aircraft flight
manual (AFM) or flight manual supplement. Flight
crew members must be thoroughly familiar with the
particular GPS equipment installed in the aircraft, the
receiver operation manual, and the AFM or flight
manual supplement. Operation, receiver presentation and capabilities of GPS equipment vary. Due to
these differences, operation of GPS receivers of
different brands, or even models of the same brand,
under IFR should not be attempted without thorough
operational knowledge. Most receivers have a
built-in simulator mode, which allows the pilot to
become familiar with operation prior to attempting
operation in the aircraft.
(5) Aircraft navigating by IFR-approved
GPS are considered to be performance-based
navigation (PBN) aircraft and have special equipment suffixes. File the appropriate equipment suffix
in accordance with TBL 5-1-3 on the ATC flight
plan. If GPS avionics become inoperative, the pilot
should advise ATC and amend the equipment suffix.
(6) Prior to any GPS IFR operation, the
pilot must review appropriate NOTAMs and
aeronautical information. (See GPS NOTAMs/Aeronautical Information).

1-1-19


(b) Database Requirements. The onboard
navigation data must be current and appropriate for
the region of intended operation and should include
the navigation aids, waypoints, and relevant coded
terminal airspace procedures for the departure,
arrival, and alternate airfields.
(1) Further database guidance for terminal
and en route requirements may be found in AC
90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area
Navigation (RNAV) Operations.
(2) Further database guidance on Required
Navigation Performance (RNP) instrument approach
operations, RNP terminal, and RNP en route
requirements may be found in AC 90-105, Approval
Guidance for RNP Operations and Barometric
Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National Airspace
System.
(3) All approach procedures to be flown
must be retrievable from the current airborne
navigation database supplied by the equipment
manufacturer or other FAA-approved source. The
system must be able to retrieve the procedure by name
from the aircraft navigation database, not just as a
manually entered series of waypoints. Manual entry
of waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is not permitted for approach procedures.
(4) Prior to using a procedure or waypoint
retrieved from the airborne navigation database, the
pilot should verify the validity of the database. This
verification should include the following preflight
and inflight steps:
[a] Preflight:
[1] Determine the date of database
issuance, and verify that the date/time of proposed
use is before the expiration date/time.
[2] Verify that the database provider
has not published a notice limiting the use of the
specific waypoint or procedure.
[b] Inflight:
[1] Determine that the waypoints
and transition names coincide with names found on
the procedure chart. Do not use waypoints which do
not exactly match the spelling shown on published
procedure charts.
[2] Determine that the waypoints are
logical in location, in the correct order, and their

1-1-20

orientation to each other is as found on the procedure
chart, both laterally and vertically.
NOTE-
There is no specific requirement to check each waypoint
latitude and longitude, type of waypoint and/or altitude
constraint, only the general relationship of waypoints in
the procedure, or the logic of an individual waypoint’s
location.

[3] If the cursory check of procedure
logic or individual waypoint location, specified in [b]
above, indicates a potential error, do not use the
retrieved procedure or waypoint until a verification of
latitude and longitude, waypoint type, and altitude
constraints indicate full conformity with the
published data.
(5) Air carrier and commercial operators
must meet the appropriate provisions of their
approved operations specifications.
[a] During domestic operations for commerce or for hire, operators must have a second
navigation system capable of reversion or contingency operations.
[b] Operators must have two independent navigation systems appropriate to the route to be
flown, or one system that is suitable and a second,
independent backup capability that allows the
operator to proceed safely and land at a different
airport, and the aircraft must have sufficient fuel
(reference 14 CFR 121.349, 125.203, 129.17, and
135.165). These rules ensure the safety of the
operation by preventing a single point of failure.
NOTE-
An aircraft approved for multi-sensor navigation and
equipped with a single navigation system must maintain an
ability to navigate or proceed safely in the event that any
one component of the navigation system fails, including the
flight management system (FMS). Retaining a FMS-independent VOR capability would satisfy this requirement.

[c] The requirements for a second
system apply to the entire set of equipment needed to
achieve the navigation capability, not just the
individual components of the system such as the radio
navigation receiver. For example, to use two RNAV
systems (e.g., GPS and DME/DME/IRU) to comply
with the requirements, the aircraft must be equipped
with two independent radio navigation receivers and
two independent navigation computers (e.g., flight
management systems (FMS)). Alternatively, to
comply with the requirements using a single RNAV
system with an installed and operable VOR

Navigation Aids

capability, the VOR capability must be independent
of the FMS.
[d] To satisfy the requirement for two
independent navigation systems, if the primary
navigation system is GPS-based, the second system
must be independent of GPS (for example, VOR or
DME/DME/IRU). This allows continued navigation
in case of failure of the GPS or WAAS services.
Recognizing that GPS interference and test events
resulting in the loss of GPS services have become
more common, the FAA requires operators conducting IFR operations under 14 CFR 121.349, 125.203,
129.17 and 135.65 to retain a non-GPS navigation
capability consisting of either DME/DME, IRU, or
VOR for en route and terminal operations, and VOR
and ILS for final approach. Since this system is to be
used as a reversionary capability, single equipage is
sufficient.
3. Oceanic, Domestic, En Route, and
Terminal Area Operations
(a) Conduct GPS IFR operations in oceanic
areas only when approved avionics systems are
installed. TSO-C196() users and TSO-C129() GPS
users authorized for Class A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2
operations may use GPS in place of another approved
means of long-range navigation, such as dual INS.
(See TBL 1-1-5 and TBL 1-1-6.) Aircraft with a
single installation GPS, meeting the above specifications, are authorized to operate on short oceanic
routes requiring one means of long-range navigation
(reference AC 20-138, Appendix 1).
(b) Conduct GPS domestic, en route, and
terminal IFR operations only when approved
avionics systems are installed. Pilots may use GPS
via TSO-C129() authorized for Class A1, B1, B3,
C1, or C3 operations GPS via TSO-C196(); or
GPS/WAAS with either TSO-C145() or
TSO-C146(). When using TSO-C129() or
TSO-C196() receivers, the avionics necessary to
receive all of the ground-based facilities appropriate
for the route to the destination airport and any
required alternate airport must be installed and
operational. Ground-based facilities necessary for
these routes must be operational.
(1) GPS en route IFR operations may be
conducted in Alaska outside the operational service
volume of ground-based navigation aids when a
TSO-C145() or TSO-C146() GPS/wide area aug-

Navigation Aids


mentation system (WAAS) system is installed and
operating. WAAS is the U.S. version of a
satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS).
[a] In Alaska, aircraft may operate on
GNSS Q-routes with GPS (TSO-C129 () or
TSO-C196 ()) equipment while the aircraft remains
in Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar surveillance or
with GPS/WAAS (TSO-C145 () or TSO-C146 ())
which does not require ATC radar surveillance.
[b] In Alaska, aircraft may only operate
on GNSS T-routes with GPS/WAAS (TSO-C145 () or
TSO-C146 ()) equipment.
(2) Ground-based navigation equipment
is not required to be installed and operating for en
route IFR operations when using GPS/WAAS
navigation systems. All operators should ensure that
an alternate means of navigation is available in the
unlikely event the GPS/WAAS navigation system
becomes inoperative.
(3) Q-routes and T-routes outside Alaska.
Q-routes require system performance currently met
by GPS, GPS/WAAS, or DME/DME/IRU RNAV
systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in AC
90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area
Navigation (RNAV) Operations. T-routes require
GPS or GPS/WAAS equipment.
REFERENCE-
AIM, Paragraph 5-3-4 , Airways and Route Systems

(c) GPS IFR approach/departure operations
can be conducted when approved avionics systems
are installed and the following requirements are met:
(1) The aircraft is TSO-C145() or TSO-
C146() or TSO-C196() or TSO-C129() in Class A1,
B1, B3, C1, or C3; and
(2) The approach/departure must be retrievable from the current airborne navigation
database in the navigation computer. The system
must be able to retrieve the procedure by name from
the aircraft navigation database. Manual entry of
waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing
is not permitted for approach procedures.
(3) The authorization to fly instrument
approaches/departures with GPS is limited to U.S.
airspace.
(4) The use of GPS in any other airspace
must be expressly authorized by the FAA Administrator.

1-1-21


(5) GPS instrument approach/departure
operations outside the U.S. must be authorized by
the appropriate sovereign authority.
4. Departures and Instrument Departure
Procedures (DPs)
The GPS receiver must be set to terminal (±1 NM)
CDI sensitivity and the navigation routes contained in
the database in order to fly published IFR charted
departures and DPs. Terminal RAIM should be
automatically provided by the receiver. (Terminal
RAIM for departure may not be available unless the
waypoints are part of the active flight plan rather than
proceeding direct to the first destination.) Certain
segments of a DP may require some manual
intervention by the pilot, especially when radar
vectored to a course or required to intercept a specific
course to a waypoint. The database may not contain
all of the transitions or departures from all runways
and some GPS receivers do not contain DPs in the
database. It is necessary that helicopter procedures be
flown at 70 knots or less since helicopter departure
procedures and missed approaches use a 20:1
obstacle clearance surface (OCS), which is double
the fixed-wing OCS, and turning areas are based on
this speed as well.
5. GPS Instrument Approach Procedures
(a) GPS overlay approaches are designated
non-precision instrument approach procedures that
pilots are authorized to fly using GPS avionics.
Localizer (LOC), localizer type directional aid
(LDA), and simplified directional facility (SDF)
procedures are not authorized. Overlay procedures
are identified by the “name of the procedure” and “or
GPS” (e.g., VOR/DME or GPS RWY 15) in the title.
Authorized procedures must be retrievable from a
current onboard navigation database. The navigation database may also enhance position orientation
by displaying a map containing information on
conventional NAVAID approaches. This approach
information should not be confused with a GPS
overlay approach (see the receiver operating
manual, AFM, or AFM Supplement for details on
how to identify these approaches in the navigation
database).
NOTE-
Overlay approaches do not adhere to the design criteria
described in Paragraph 5-4-5m, Area Navigation (RNAV)
Instrument Approach Charts, for stand-alone GPS

1-1-22

approaches. Overlay approach criteria is based on the
design criteria used for ground-based NAVAID approaches.

(b) Stand-alone approach procedures specifically designed for GPS systems have replaced
many of the original overlay approaches. All
approaches that contain “GPS” in the title (e.g.,
“VOR or GPS RWY 24,” “GPS RWY 24,” or
“RNAV (GPS) RWY 24”) can be flown using GPS.
GPS-equipped aircraft do not need underlying
ground-based NAVAIDs or associated aircraft
avionics to fly the approach. Monitoring the
underlying approach with ground-based NAVAIDs is
suggested when able. Existing overlay approaches
may be requested using the GPS title; for example,
the VOR or GPS RWY 24 may be requested as “GPS
RWY 24.” Some GPS procedures have a Terminal
Arrival Area (TAA) with an underlining RNAV
approach.
(c) For flight planning purposes,
TSO-C129() and TSO-C196()-equipped users
(GPS users) whose navigation systems have fault
detection and exclusion (FDE) capability, who
perform a preflight RAIM prediction for the
approach integrity at the airport where the RNAV
(GPS) approach will be flown, and have proper
knowledge and any required training and/or
approval to conduct a GPS-based IAP, may file
based on a GPS-based IAP at either the destination
or the alternate airport, but not at both locations. At
the alternate airport, pilots may plan for:
(1) Lateral navigation (LNAV) or circling
minimum descent altitude (MDA);
(2) LNAV/vertical navigation (LNAV/
VNAV) DA, if equipped with and using approved
barometric vertical navigation (baro-VNAV) equipment;
(3) RNP 0.3 DA on an RNAV (RNP) IAP,
if they are specifically authorized users using
approved baro-VNAV equipment and the pilot has
verified required navigation performance (RNP)
availability through an approved prediction program.
(d) If the above conditions cannot be met, any
required alternate airport must have an approved
instrument approach procedure other than GPS-
based that is anticipated to be operational and
available at the estimated time of arrival, and which
the aircraft is equipped to fly.

Navigation Aids

(e) Procedures for Accomplishing GPS
Approaches
(1) An RNAV (GPS) procedure may be
associated with a Terminal Arrival Area (TAA). The
basic design of the RNAV procedure is the “T” design
or a modification of the “T” (See Paragraph 5-4-5d,
Terminal Arrival Area (TAA), for complete information).
(2) Pilots cleared by ATC for an RNAV
(GPS) approach should fly the full approach from an
Initial Approach Waypoint (IAWP) or feeder fix.
Randomly joining an approach at an intermediate fix
does not assure terrain clearance.
(3) When an approach has been loaded in
the navigation system, GPS receivers will give an
“arm” annunciation 30 NM straight line distance
from the airport/heliport reference point. Pilots
should arm the approach mode at this time if not
already armed (some receivers arm automatically).
Without arming, the receiver will not change from
en route CDI and RAIM sensitivity of ±5 NM either
side of centerline to ±1 NM terminal sensitivity.
Where the IAWP is inside this 30 mile point, a CDI
sensitivity change will occur once the approach mode
is armed and the aircraft is inside 30 NM. Where the
IAWP is beyond 30 NM from the airport/heliport
reference point and the approach is armed, the CDI
sensitivity will not change until the aircraft is within
30 miles of the airport/heliport reference point.
Feeder route obstacle clearance is predicated on the
receiver being in terminal (±1 NM) CDI sensitivity
and RAIM within 30 NM of the airport/heliport
reference point; therefore, the receiver should always
be armed (if required) not later than the 30 NM
annunciation.
(4) The pilot must be aware of what bank
angle/turn rate the particular receiver uses to compute
turn anticipation, and whether wind and airspeed are
included in the receiver’s calculations. This information should be in the receiver operating manual. Over
or under banking the turn onto the final approach
course may significantly delay getting on course and
may result in high descent rates to achieve the next
segment altitude.
(5) When within 2 NM of the Final
Approach Waypoint (FAWP) with the approach
mode armed, the approach mode will switch to
active, which results in RAIM and CDI changing to

Navigation Aids


approach sensitivity. Beginning 2 NM prior to the
FAWP, the full scale CDI sensitivity will smoothly
change from ±1 NM to ±0.3 NM at the FAWP. As
sensitivity changes from ±1 NM to ±0.3 NM
approaching the FAWP, with the CDI not centered,
the corresponding increase in CDI displacement
may give the impression that the aircraft is moving
further away from the intended course even though it
is on an acceptable intercept heading. Referencing the
digital track displacement information (cross track
error), if it is available in the approach mode, may
help the pilot remain position oriented in this
situation. Being established on the final approach
course prior to the beginning of the sensitivity change
at 2 NM will help prevent problems in interpreting the
CDI display during ramp down. Therefore, requesting or accepting vectors which will cause the aircraft
to intercept the final approach course within 2 NM of
the FAWP is not recommended.
(6) When receiving vectors to final, most
receiver operating manuals suggest placing the
receiver in the non-sequencing mode on the FAWP
and manually setting the course. This provides an
extended final approach course in cases where the
aircraft is vectored onto the final approach course
outside of any existing segment which is aligned with
the runway. Assigned altitudes must be maintained
until established on a published segment of the
approach. Required altitudes at waypoints outside the
FAWP or stepdown fixes must be considered.
Calculating the distance to the FAWP may be
required in order to descend at the proper location.
(7) Overriding an automatically selected
sensitivity during an approach will cancel the
approach mode annunciation. If the approach mode
is not armed by 2 NM prior to the FAWP, the approach
mode will not become active at 2 NM prior to the
FAWP, and the equipment will flag. In these
conditions, the RAIM and CDI sensitivity will not
ramp down, and the pilot should not descend to MDA,
but fly to the MAWP and execute a missed approach.
The approach active annunciator and/or the receiver
should be checked to ensure the approach mode is
active prior to the FAWP.
(8) Do not attempt to fly an approach unless
the procedure in the onboard database is current and
identified as “GPS” on the approach chart. The
navigation database may contain information about
non-overlay approach procedures that enhances
position orientation generally by providing a map,

1-1-23

while flying these approaches using conventional
NAVAIDs. This approach information should not be
confused with a GPS overlay approach (see the
receiver operating manual, AFM, or AFM Supplement for details on how to identify these procedures
in the navigation database). Flying point to point on
the approach does not assure compliance with the
published approach procedure. The proper RAIM
sensitivity will not be available and the CDI
sensitivity will not automatically change to ±0.3
NM. Manually setting CDI sensitivity does not
automatically change the RAIM sensitivity on some
receivers. Some existing non-precision approach
procedures cannot be coded for use with GPS and will
not be available as overlays.
(9) Pilots should pay particular attention
to the exact operation of their GPS receivers for
performing holding patterns and in the case of
overlay approaches, operations such as procedure
turns. These procedures may require manual
intervention by the pilot to stop the sequencing of
waypoints by the receiver and to resume automatic
GPS navigation sequencing once the maneuver is
complete. The same waypoint may appear in the route
of flight more than once consecutively (for example,
IAWP, FAWP, MAHWP on a procedure turn). Care
must be exercised to ensure that the receiver is
sequenced to the appropriate waypoint for the
segment of the procedure being flown, especially if
one or more fly-overs are skipped (for example,
FAWP rather than IAWP if the procedure turn is not
flown). The pilot may have to sequence past one or
more fly-overs of the same waypoint in order to start
GPS automatic sequencing at the proper place in the
sequence of waypoints.
(10) Incorrect inputs into the GPS receiver
are especially critical during approaches. In some
cases, an incorrect entry can cause the receiver to
leave the approach mode.
(11) A fix on an overlay approach identified by a DME fix will not be in the waypoint
sequence on the GPS receiver unless there is a
published name assigned to it. When a name is
assigned, the along track distance (ATD) to the
waypoint may be zero rather than the DME stated on
the approach chart. The pilot should be alert for this
on any overlay procedure where the original
approach used DME.

1-1-24


(12) If a visual descent point (VDP) is
published, it will not be included in the sequence of
waypoints. Pilots are expected to use normal piloting
techniques for beginning the visual descent, such as
ATD.
(13) Unnamed stepdown fixes in the final
approach segment may or may not be coded in the
waypoint sequence of the aircraft’s navigation
database and must be identified using ATD.
Stepdown fixes in the final approach segment of
RNAV (GPS) approaches are being named, in
addition to being identified by ATD. However, GPS
avionics may or may not accommodate waypoints
between the FAF and MAP. Pilots must know the
capabilities of their GPS equipment and continue to
identify stepdown fixes using ATD when necessary.
(f) Missed Approach
(1) A GPS missed approach requires pilot
action to sequence the receiver past the MAWP to the
missed approach portion of the procedure. The pilot
must be thoroughly familiar with the activation
procedure for the particular GPS receiver installed in
the aircraft and must initiate appropriate action after
the MAWP. Activating the missed approach prior to
the MAWP will cause CDI sensitivity to immediately
change to terminal (±1NM) sensitivity and the
receiver will continue to navigate to the MAWP. The
receiver will not sequence past the MAWP. Turns
should not begin prior to the MAWP. If the missed
approach is not activated, the GPS receiver will
display an extension of the inbound final approach
course and the ATD will increase from the MAWP
until it is manually sequenced after crossing the
MAWP.
(2) Missed approach routings in which the
first track is via a course rather than direct to the next
waypoint require additional action by the pilot to set
the course. Being familiar with all of the inputs
required is especially critical during this phase of
flight.
tion

(g) GPS NOTAMs/Aeronautical Informa-

(1) GPS satellite outages are issued as
GPS NOTAMs both domestically and internationally. However, the effect of an outage on the intended
operation cannot be determined unless the pilot has a
RAIM availability prediction program which allows
excluding a satellite which is predicted to be out of
service based on the NOTAM information.

Navigation Aids

(2) The terms UNRELIABLE and MAY
NOT BE AVAILABLE are used in conjunction with
GPS NOTAMs. Both UNRELIABLE and MAY NOT
BE AVAILABLE are advisories to pilots indicating
the expected level of service may not be available.
UNRELIABLE does not mean there is a problem
with GPS signal integrity. If GPS service is available,
pilots may continue operations. If the LNAV or
LNAV/VNAV service is available, pilots may use the
displayed level of service to fly the approach. GPS
operation may be NOTAMed UNRELIABLE or
MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE due to testing or
anomalies. (Pilots are encouraged to report GPS
anomalies, including degraded operation and/or loss
of service, as soon as possible, reference paragraph
1-1-13.) When GPS testing NOTAMS are published
and testing is actually occurring, Air Traffic Control
will advise pilots requesting or cleared for a GPS or
RNAV (GPS) approach that GPS may not be
available and request intentions. If pilots have
reported GPS anomalies, Air Traffic Control will
request the pilot’s intentions and/or clear the pilot for
an alternate approach, if available and operational.
EXAMPLE-
The following is an example of a GPS testing NOTAM:
!GPS 06/001 ZAB NAV GPS (INCLUDING WAAS, GBAS,
AND ADS-B) MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN A
468NM RADIUS CENTERED AT 330702N1062540W
(TCS 093044) FL400-UNL DECREASING IN AREA
WITH A DECREASE IN ALTITUDE DEFINED AS:
425NM RADIUS AT FL250, 360NM RADIUS AT
10000FT, 354NM RADIUS AT 4000FT AGL, 327NM
RADIUS AT 50FT AGL. 1406070300-1406071200.

(3) Civilian pilots may obtain GPS RAIM
availability information for non-precision approach
procedures by using a manufacturer-supplied RAIM
prediction tool, or using the Service Availability
Prediction Tool (SAPT) on the FAA en route and
terminal RAIM prediction website. Pilots can also
request GPS RAIM aeronautical information from a
flight service station during preflight briefings. GPS
RAIM aeronautical information can be obtained for
a period of 3 hours (for example, if you are scheduled
to arrive at 1215 hours, then the GPS RAIM
information is available from 1100 to 1400 hours) or
a 24-hour timeframe at a particular airport. FAA
briefers will provide RAIM information for a period
of 1 hour before to 1 hour after the ETA hour, unless
a specific timeframe is requested by the pilot. If flying
a published GPS departure, a RAIM prediction
should also be requested for the departure airport.

Navigation Aids


(4) The military provides airfield specific
GPS RAIM NOTAMs for non-precision approach
procedures at military airfields. The RAIM outages
are issued as M-series NOTAMs and may be obtained
for up to 24 hours from the time of request.
(5) Receiver manufacturers and/or database suppliers may supply “NOTAM” type
information concerning database errors. Pilots
should check these sources, when available, to ensure
that they have the most current information
concerning their electronic database.
(h) Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)
(1) RAIM outages may occur due to an
insufficient number of satellites or due to unsuitable
satellite geometry which causes the error in the
position solution to become too large. Loss of satellite
reception and RAIM warnings may occur due to
aircraft dynamics (changes in pitch or bank angle).
Antenna location on the aircraft, satellite position
relative to the horizon, and aircraft attitude may affect
reception of one or more satellites. Since the relative
positions of the satellites are constantly changing,
prior experience with the airport does not guarantee
reception at all times, and RAIM availability should
always be checked.
(2) If RAIM is not available, use another
type of navigation and approach system, select
another route or destination, or delay the trip until
RAIM is predicted to be available on arrival. On
longer flights, pilots should consider rechecking the
RAIM prediction for the destination during the flight.
This may provide an early indication that an
unscheduled satellite outage has occurred since
takeoff.
(3) If a RAIM failure/status annunciation
occurs prior to the final approach waypoint
(FAWP), the approach should not be completed since
GPS no longer provides the required integrity. The
receiver performs a RAIM prediction by 2 NM prior
to the FAWP to ensure that RAIM is available as a
condition for entering the approach mode. The pilot
should ensure the receiver has sequenced from
“Armed” to “Approach” prior to the FAWP (normally
occurs 2 NM prior). Failure to sequence may be an
indication of the detection of a satellite anomaly,
failure to arm the receiver (if required), or other
problems which preclude flying the approach.

1-1-25


(4) If the receiver does not sequence into
the approach mode or a RAIM failure/status
annunciation occurs prior to the FAWP, the pilot must
not initiate the approach or descend, but instead
proceed to the missed approach waypoint ( MAWP)
via the FAWP, perform a missed approach, and
contact ATC as soon as practical. The GPS receiver
may continue to operate after a RAIM flag/status
annunciation appears, but the navigation information
should be considered advisory only. Refer to the
receiver operating manual for specific indications
and instructions associated with loss of RAIM prior
to the FAF.
(5) If the RAIM flag/status annunciation
appears after the FAWP, the pilot should initiate a
climb and execute the missed approach. The GPS
receiver may continue to operate after a RAIM
flag/status annunciation appears, but the navigation
information should be considered advisory only.
Refer to the receiver operating manual for operating
mode information during a RAIM annunciation.
(i) Waypoints
(1) GPS receivers navigate from one
defined point to another retrieved from the aircraft’s
onboard navigational database. These points are
waypoints (5-letter pronounceable name), existing
VHF intersections, DME fixes with 5-letter
pronounceable names and 3-letter NAVAID IDs.
Each waypoint is a geographical location defined by
a latitude/longitude geographic coordinate. These
5-letter waypoints, VHF intersections, 5-letter
pronounceable DME fixes and 3-letter NAVAID IDs
are published on various FAA aeronautical navigation products (IFR Enroute Charts, VFR Charts,
Terminal Procedures Publications, etc.).
(2) A Computer Navigation Fix (CNF) is
also a point defined by a latitude/longitude coordinate
and is required to support Performance-Based
Navigation (PBN) operations. The GPS receiver uses
CNFs in conjunction with waypoints to navigate from
point to point. However, CNFs are not recognized by
ATC. ATC does not maintain CNFs in their database
and they do not use CNFs for any air traffic control
purpose. CNFs may or may not be charted on FAA
aeronautical navigation products, are listed in the
chart legends, and are for advisory purposes only.

1-1-26

Pilots are not to use CNFs for point to point
navigation (proceed direct), filing a flight plan, or in
aircraft/ATC communications. CNFs that do appear
on aeronautical charts allow pilots increased
situational awareness by identifying points in the
aircraft database route of flight with points on the
aeronautical chart. CNFs are random five-letter
identifiers, not pronounceable like waypoints and
placed in parenthesis. Eventually, all CNFs will begin
with the letters “CF” followed by three consonants
(for example, CFWBG). This five-letter identifier
will be found next to an “x” on enroute charts and
possibly on an approach chart. On instrument
approach procedures (charts) in the terminal
procedures publication, CNFs may represent unnamed DME fixes, beginning and ending points of
DME arcs, and sensor (ground-based signal i.e.,
VOR, NDB, ILS) final approach fixes on GPS
overlay approaches. These CNFs provide the GPS
with points on the procedure that allow the overlay
approach to mirror the ground-based sensor
approach. These points should only be used by the
GPS system for navigation and should not be used by
pilots for any other purpose on the approach. The
CNF concept has not been adopted or recognized by
the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).
(3) GPS approaches use fly-over and
fly-by waypoints to join route segments on an
approach. Fly-by waypoints connect the two
segments by allowing the aircraft to turn prior to the
current waypoint in order to roll out on course to the
next waypoint. This is known as turn anticipation and
is compensated for in the airspace and terrain
clearances. The MAWP and the missed approach
holding waypoint (MAHWP) are normally the only
two waypoints on the approach that are not fly-by
waypoints. Fly-over waypoints are used when the
aircraft must overfly the waypoint prior to starting a
turn to the new course. The symbol for a fly-over
waypoint is a circled waypoint. Some waypoints may
have dual use; for example, as a fly-by waypoint
when used as an IF for a NoPT route and as a fly-over
waypoint when the same waypoint is also used as an
IAF/IF hold-in-lieu of PT. When this occurs, the less
restrictive (fly-by) symbology will be charted.
Overlay approach charts and some early stand-alone
GPS approach charts may not reflect this convention.

Navigation Aids

(4) Unnamed waypoints for each airport
will be uniquely identified in the database. Although
the identifier may be used at different airports (for
example, RW36 will be the identifier at each airport
with a runway 36), the actual point, at each airport, is
defined by a specific latitude/longitude coordinate.
(5) The runway threshold waypoint, normally the MAWP, may have a five-letter identifier
(for example, SNEEZ) or be coded as RW## (for
example, RW36, RW36L). MAWPs located at the
runway threshold are being changed to the RW##
identifier, while MAWPs not located at the threshold
will have a five-letter identifier. This may cause the
approach chart to differ from the aircraft database
until all changes are complete. The runway threshold
waypoint is also used as the center of the Minimum
Safe Altitude (MSA) on most GPS approaches.
(j) Position Orientation.
Pilots should pay particular attention to position
orientation while using GPS. Distance and track
information are provided to the next active
waypoint, not to a fixed navigation aid. Receivers
may sequence when the pilot is not flying along an
active route, such as when being vectored or
deviating for weather, due to the proximity to another
waypoint in the route. This can be prevented by
placing the receiver in the non-sequencing mode.
When the receiver is in the non-sequencing mode,
bearing and distance are provided to the selected
waypoint and the receiver will not sequence to the
next waypoint in the route until placed back in the
auto sequence mode or the pilot selects a different
waypoint. The pilot may have to compute the ATD
to stepdown fixes and other points on overlay
approaches, due to the receiver showing ATD to the
next waypoint rather than DME to the VOR or ILS
ground station.
(k) Impact of Magnetic Variation on PBN
Systems
(1) Differences may exist between PBN
systems and the charted magnetic courses on
ground-based NAVAID instrument flight procedures
(IFP), enroute charts, approach charts, and Standard
Instrument Departure/Standard Terminal Arrival
(SID/STAR) charts. These differences are due to the
magnetic variance used to calculate the magnetic

Navigation Aids


course. Every leg of an instrument procedure is first
computed along a desired ground track with reference
to true north. A magnetic variation correction is then
applied to the true course in order to calculate a
magnetic course for publication. The type of
procedure will determine what magnetic variation
value is added to the true course. A ground-based
NAVAID IFP applies the facility magnetic variation
of record to the true course to get the charted magnetic
course. Magnetic courses on PBN procedures are
calculated two different ways. SID/STAR procedures
use the airport magnetic variation of record, while
IFR enroute charts use magnetic reference bearing.
PBN systems make a correction to true north by
adding a magnetic variation calculated with an
algorithm based on aircraft position, or by adding the
magnetic variation coded in their navigational
database. This may result in the PBN system and the
procedure designer using a different magnetic
variation, which causes the magnetic course
displayed by the PBN system and the magnetic course
charted on the IFP plate to be different. It is important
to understand, however, that PBN systems, (with the
exception of VOR/DME RNAV equipment) navigate
by reference to true north and display magnetic
course only for pilot reference. As such, a properly
functioning PBN system, containing a current and
accurate navigational database, should fly the
correct ground track for any loaded instrument
procedure, despite differences in displayed magnetic
course that may be attributed to magnetic variation
application. Should significant differences between
the approach chart and the PBN system avionics’
application of the navigation database arise, the
published approach chart, supplemented by NOTAMs, holds precedence.
(2) The course into a waypoint may not
always be 180 degrees different from the course
leaving the previous waypoint, due to the PBN
system avionics’ computation of geodesic paths,
distance between waypoints, and differences in
magnetic variation application. Variations in
distances may also occur since PBN system
distance-to-waypoint values are ATDs computed to
the next waypoint and the DME values published on
underlying procedures are slant-range distances
measured to the station. This difference increases
with aircraft altitude and proximity to the NAVAID.

and the conditions under which terminal RAIM is
available for departure;

(10) Programming and flying an approach
with radar vectors to the intermediate segment;
(11) Indication of the actions required for
RAIM failure both before and after the FAWP; and
