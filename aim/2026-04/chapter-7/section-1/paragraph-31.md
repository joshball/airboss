Organization (ICAO) Weather Formats

(b) Nonroutine (Special) Aviation Weather
Report (SPECI).

The U.S. uses the ICAO world standard for aviation
weather reporting and forecasting. The World
Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) publication
No. 782 “Aerodrome Reports and Forecasts”
contains the base METAR and TAF code as adopted
by the WMO member countries.

The type of report (METAR or SPECI) will always
appear as the lead element of the report.

a. Although the METAR code is adopted
worldwide, each country is allowed to make
modifications or exceptions to the code for use in
their particular country, e.g., the U.S. will continue to
use statute miles for visibility, feet for RVR values,
knots for wind speed, and inches of mercury for
altimetry. However, temperature and dew point will
be reported in degrees Celsius. The U.S reports
prevailing visibility rather than lowest sector
visibility. The elements in the body of a METAR
report are separated with a space. The only exceptions
are RVR, temperature, and dew point which are
separated with a solidus (/). When an element does
not occur, or cannot be observed, the preceding space
and that element are omitted from that particular
report. A METAR report contains the following
sequence of elements in the following order:
1. Type of report.
2. ICAO Station Identifier.
3. Date and time of report.
4. Modifier (as required).
5. Wind.
6. Visibility.
7. Runway Visual Range (RVR).
8. Weather phenomena.
9. Sky conditions.
10. Temperature/dew point group.
11. Altimeter.
12. Remarks (RMK).
b. The following paragraphs describe the elements in a METAR report.
1. Type of report. There are two types of
report:
(a) Aviation Routine Weather Report
(METAR); and

7-1-62

2. ICAO Station Identifier. The METAR
code uses ICAO 4-letter station identifiers. In the
contiguous 48 States, the 3-letter domestic station
identifier is prefixed with a “K;” i.e., the domestic
identifier for Seattle is SEA while the ICAO identifier
is KSEA. Elsewhere, the first two letters of the ICAO
identifier indicate what region of the world and
country (or state) the station is in. For Alaska, all
station identifiers start with “PA;” for Hawaii, all
station identifiers start with “PH.” Canadian station
identifiers start with “CU,” “CW,” “CY,” and “CZ.”
Mexican station identifiers start with “MM.” The
identifier for the western Caribbean is “M” followed
by the individual country’s letter; i.e., Cuba is “MU;”
Dominican Republic “MD;” the Bahamas “MY.” The
identifier for the eastern Caribbean is “T” followed
by the individual country’s letter; i.e., Puerto Rico is
“TJ.” For a complete worldwide listing see ICAO
Document 7910, Location Indicators.
3. Date and Time of Report. The date and
time the observation is taken are transmitted as a
six-digit date/time group appended with Z to denote
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The first two
digits are the date followed with two digits for hour
and two digits for minutes.
EXAMPLE-
172345Z (the 17 th day of the month at 2345Z)

4. Modifier (As Required). “AUTO” identifies a METAR/SPECI report as an automated weather
report with no human intervention. If “AUTO” is
shown in the body of the report, the type of sensor
equipment used at the station will be encoded in the
remarks section of the report. The absence of
“AUTO” indicates that a report was made manually
by an observer or that an automated report had human
augmentation/backup. The modifier “COR” indicates a corrected report that is sent out to replace an
earlier report with an error.
NOTE-
There are two types of automated stations, AO1 for
automated weather reporting stations without a precipitation discriminator, and AO2 for automated stations with a
precipitation discriminator. (A precipitation discriminator
can determine the difference between liquid and
frozen/freezing precipitation). This information appears in
the remarks section of an automated report.

Meteorology

5. Wind. The wind is reported as a five digit
group (six digits if speed is over 99 knots). The first
three digits are the direction the wind is blowing
from, in tens of degrees referenced to true north, or
“VRB” if the direction is variable. The next two digits
is the wind speed in knots, or if over 99 knots, the next
three digits. If the wind is gusty, it is reported as a “G”
after the speed followed by the highest gust reported.
The abbreviation “KT” is appended to denote the use
of knots for wind speed.
EXAMPLE-
13008KT - wind from 130 degrees at 8 knots
08032G45KT - wind from 080 degrees at 32 knots with
gusts to 45 knots
VRB04KT - wind variable in direction at 4 knots
00000KT - wind calm
210103G130KT - wind from 210 degrees at 103 knots with
gusts to 130 knots
If the wind direction is variable by 60 degrees or more and
the speed is greater than 6 knots, a variable group
consisting of the extremes of the wind direction separated
by a “v” will follow the prevailing wind group.
32012G22KT 280V350

(a) Peak Wind. Whenever the peak wind
exceeds 25 knots “PK WND” will be included in
Remarks, e.g., PK WND 28045/1955 “Peak wind two
eight zero at four five occurred at one niner five five.”
If the hour can be inferred from the report time, only
the minutes will be appended, e.g., PK WND
34050/38 “Peak wind three four zero at five zero
occurred at three eight past the hour.”
(b) Wind shift. Whenever a wind shift
occurs, “WSHFT” will be included in remarks
followed by the time the wind shift began, e.g.,
WSHFT 30 FROPA “Wind shift at three zero due to
frontal passage.”
6. Visibility. Prevailing visibility is reported in
statute miles with “SM” appended to it.
EXAMPLE-
7SM - seven statute miles
15SM - fifteen statute miles
1/ SM - one-half statute mile
2

(a) Tower/surface visibility. If either visibility (tower or surface) is below four statute miles,

Meteorology


the lesser of the two will be reported in the body of the
report; the greater will be reported in remarks.
(b) Automated visibility. ASOS/AWSS
visibility stations will show visibility 10 or greater
than 10 miles as “10SM.” AWOS visibility stations
will show visibility less than 1/4 statute mile as
“M1/4SM” and visibility 10 or greater than 10 miles
as “10SM.”
NOTE-
Automated sites that are augmented by human observer to
meet service level requirements can report 0, 1/16 SM, and
1/8 SM visibility increments.

(c) Variable visibility. Variable visibility is
shown in remarks (when rapid increase or decrease
by 1/2 statute mile or more and the average prevailing
visibility is less than three miles) e.g., VIS 1V2
“visibility variable between one and two.”
(d) Sector visibility. Sector visibility is
shown in remarks when it differs from the prevailing
visibility, and either the prevailing or sector visibility
is less than three miles.
EXAMPLE-

VIS N2 - visibility north two
7. Runway Visual Range (When Reported).
“R” identifies the group followed by the runway
heading (and parallel runway designator, if needed)
“/” and the visual range in feet (meters in other
countries) followed with “FT” (feet is not spoken).
(a) Variability Values. When RVR varies
(by more than on reportable value), the lowest and
highest values are shown with “V” between them.
(b) Maximum/Minimum Range. “P” indicates an observed RVR is above the maximum value
for this system (spoken as “more than”). “M”
indicates an observed RVR is below the minimum
value which can be determined by the system (spoken
as “less than”).
EXAMPLE-
R32L/1200FT - runway three two left R-V-R one thousand
two hundred.
R27R/M1000V4000FT - runway two seven right R-V-R
variable from less than one thousand to four thousand.

8. Weather Phenomena. The weather as
reported in the METAR code represents a significant
change in the way weather is currently reported. In
METAR, weather is reported in the format:
Intensity/Proximity/Descriptor/Precipitation/
Obstruction to visibility/Other
NOTE-
The “/” above and in the following descriptions (except as
the separator between the temperature and dew point) are
for separation purposes in this publication and do not
appear in the actual METARs.

(a) Intensity applies only to the first type of
precipitation reported. A “-” denotes light, no symbol
denotes moderate, and a “+” denotes heavy.
(b) Proximity applies to and reported only
for weather occurring in the vicinity of the airport
(between 5 and 10 miles of the point(s) of
observation). It is denoted by the letters “VC.”
(Intensity and “VC” will not appear together in the
weather group).
(c) Descriptor. These eight descriptors apply to the precipitation or obstructions to visibility:
TS . . . . . . . . . . . thunderstorm
DR . . . . . . . . . . . low drifting
SH . . . . . . . . . . . showers
MI . . . . . . . . . . . shallow
FZ . . . . . . . . . . . freezing
BC . . . . . . . . . . . patches
BL . . . . . . . . . . . blowing
PR . . . . . . . . . . . partial
NOTE-
Although “TS” and “SH” are used with precipitation and
may be preceded with an intensity symbol, the intensity still
applies to the precipitation, not the descriptor.

(d) Precipitation. There are nine types of
precipitation in the METAR code:
RA . . . . . . . . . . rain
DZ . . . . . . . . . . drizzle
SN . . . . . . . . . . snow
GR . . . . . . . . . . hail (1/4” or greater)
GS . . . . . . . . . . small hail/snow pellets
PL . . . . . . . . . . ice pellets
SG . . . . . . . . . . snow grains
IC . . . . . . . . . . . ice crystals (diamond dust)
UP . . . . . . . . . . unknown precipitation
(automated stations only)

7-1-64


(e) Obstructions to visibility. There are
eight types of obscuration phenomena in the METAR
code (obscurations are any phenomena in the
atmosphere, other than precipitation, that reduce
horizontal visibility):
FG . . . . . . . . . . fog (vsby less than 5/8 mile)
HZ . . . . . . . . . . haze
FU . . . . . . . . . . smoke
PY . . . . . . . . . . spray
BR . . . . . . . . . . mist (vsby 5/8 - 6 miles)
SA . . . . . . . . . . sand
DU . . . . . . . . . . dust
VA . . . . . . . . . . volcanic ash
NOTE-
Fog (FG) is observed or forecast only when the visibility is
less than five-eighths of mile, otherwise mist (BR) is
observed or forecast.

(f) Other. There are five categories of other
weather phenomena which are reported when they
occur:
SQ . . . . . . . . . . . squall
SS . . . . . . . . . . . sandstorm
DS . . . . . . . . . . . duststorm
PO . . . . . . . . . . dust/sand whirls
FC . . . . . . . . . . . funnel cloud
+FC . . . . . . . . . tornado/waterspout
Examples:
TSRA . . . . . . . . . thunderstorm with moderate
rain
+SN . . . . . . . . . . heavy snow
-RA FG . . . . . . . light rain and fog
BRHZ . . . . . . . . mist and haze
(visibility 5/8 mile or greater)
FZDZ . . . . . . . . . freezing drizzle
VCSH . . . . . . . . rain shower in the vicinity
+SHRASNPL . . heavy rain showers, snow,
ice pellets (intensity
indicator refers to the
predominant rain)
9. Sky Condition. The sky condition as
reported in METAR represents a significant change
from the way sky condition is currently reported. In
METAR, sky condition is reported in the format:
Amount/Height/(Type) or Indefinite Ceiling/Height

Meteorology

(a) Amount. The amount of sky cover is
reported in eighths of sky cover, using the
contractions:
SKC . . . . . . . . . clear (no clouds)
FEW . . . . . . . . >0 to 2/8
SCT . . . . . . . . . scattered (3/8s to 4/8s of
clouds)
BKN . . . . . . . . . broken (5/8s to 7/8s of clouds)
OVC . . . . . . . . . overcast (8/8s clouds)
CB . . . . . . . . . . Cumulonimbus when present
TCU . . . . . . . . . Towering cumulus when
present
NOTE-
1. “SKC” will be reported at manual stations. “CLR” will
be used at automated stations when no clouds below
12,000 feet are reported.
2. A ceiling layer is not designated in the METAR code.
For aviation purposes, the ceiling is the lowest broken or
overcast layer, or vertical visibility into an obscuration.
Also there is no provision for reporting thin layers in the
METAR code. When clouds are thin, that layer must be
reported as if it were opaque.

(b) Height. Cloud bases are reported with
three digits in hundreds of feet above ground level
(AGL). (Clouds above 12,000 feet cannot be reported
by an automated station).
(c) (Type). If Towering Cumulus Clouds
(TCU) or Cumulonimbus Clouds (CB) are present,
they are reported after the height which represents
their base.
EXAMPLE-
(Reported as) SCT025TCU BKN080 BKN250 (spoken as)
“TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SCATTERED
TOWERING CUMULUS, CEILING EIGHT THOUSAND
BROKEN, TWO FIVE THOUSAND BROKEN.”
(Reported as) SCT008 OVC012CB (spoken as) “EIGHT
HUNDRED SCATTERED CEILING ONE THOUSAND
TWO HUNDRED OVERCAST CUMULONIMBUS
CLOUDS.”

(d) Vertical Visibility (indefinite ceiling
height). The height into an indefinite ceiling is
preceded by “VV” and followed by three digits
indicating the vertical visibility in hundreds of feet.
This layer indicates total obscuration.
EXAMPLE-
1/ SM FG VV006 - visibility one eighth, fog, indefinite
8
ceiling six hundred.

Meteorology


(e) Obscurations are reported when the sky
is partially obscured by a ground-based phenomena
by indicating the amount of obscuration as FEW,
SCT, BKN followed by three zeros (000). In remarks,
the obscuring phenomenon precedes the amount of
obscuration and three zeros.
EXAMPLE-
BKN000 (in body) . . . . . . . . “sky partially obscured”
FU BKN000 (in remarks) . . . “smoke obscuring five-
to seven-eighths of the
sky”

(f) When sky conditions include a layer aloft,
other than clouds, such as smoke or haze the type of
phenomena, sky cover and height are shown in
remarks.
EXAMPLE-
BKN020 (in body) . . . . . . . . “ceiling two thousand
broken”
RMK FU BKN020 . . . . . . . . “broken layer of smoke
aloft, based at
two thousand”

(g) Variable ceiling. When a ceiling is
below three thousand and is variable, the remark
“CIG” will be shown followed with the lowest and
highest ceiling heights separated by a “V.”
EXAMPLE-
CIG 005V010 . . . . . . . . . . . . “ceiling variable
between five hundred and
one thousand”

(h) Second site sensor. When an automated
station uses meteorological discontinuity sensors,
remarks will be shown to identify site specific sky
conditions which differ and are lower than conditions
reported in the body.
EXAMPLE-
CIG 020 RY11 . . . . . . . . . . . “ceiling two thousand at
runway one one”

(i) Variable cloud layer. When a layer is
varying in sky cover, remarks will show the
variability range. If there is more than one cloud
layer, the variable layer will be identified by
including the layer height.
EXAMPLE-
SCT V BKN . . . . . . . . . . . . . “scattered layer variable to
broken”
BKN025 V OVC . . . . . . . . . “broken layer at
two thousand five hundred
variable to overcast”

7-1-65

(j) Significant clouds. When significant
clouds are observed, they are shown in remarks,
along with the specified information as shown below:
(1) Cumulonimbus (CB), or Cumulonimbus Mammatus (CBMAM), distance (if known),
direction from the station, and direction of
movement, if known. If the clouds are beyond
10 miles from the airport, DSNT will indicate
distance.
EXAMPLE-
CB W MOV E . . . . . . . “cumulonimbus west moving
east”
CBMAM DSNT S . . . . “cumulonimbus mammatus
distant south”

(2) Towering Cumulus (TCU), location, (if
known), or direction from the station.
EXAMPLE-
TCU OHD . . . . . . . . . “towering cumulus overhead”
TCU W . . . . . . . . . . . . “towering cumulus west”

(3) Altocumulus Castellanus (ACC), Stratocumulus Standing Lenticular (SCSL),
Altocumulus Standing Lenticular (ACSL), Cirrocumulus Standing Lenticular (CCSL) or rotor clouds,
describing the clouds (if needed) and the direction
from the station.
EXAMPLE-
ACC W . . . . . . . . . . . . . “altocumulus castellanus west”
ACSL SW-S . . . . . . . . . “standing lenticular
altocumulus southwest
through south”
APRNT ROTOR CLD S “apparent rotor cloud south”
CCSL OVR MT E . . . . . “standing lenticular
cirrocumulus over the
mountains east”

10. Temperature/Dew Point. Temperature
and dew point are reported in two, two-digit groups
in degrees Celsius, separated by a solidus (“/”).
Temperatures below zero are prefixed with an “M.”
If the temperature is available but the dew point is
missing, the temperature is shown followed by a
solidus. If the temperature is missing, the group is
omitted from the report.
EXAMPLE-
15/08 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . “temperature one five,
dew point 8”
00/M02 . . . . . . . . . . . . “temperature zero,
dew point minus 2”

7-1-66


M05/ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . “temperature minus five,
dew point missing”

11. Altimeter. Altimeter settings are reported
in a four-digit format in inches of mercury prefixed
with an “A” to denote the units of pressure.
EXAMPLE-
A2995 - “Altimeter two niner niner five”

12. Remarks. Remarks will be included in all
observations, when appropriate. The contraction
“RMK” denotes the start of the remarks section of a
METAR report.
Except for precipitation, phenomena located within
5 statute miles of the point of observation will be
reported as at the station. Phenomena between 5 and
10 statute miles will be reported in the vicinity, “VC.”
Precipitation not occurring at the point of observation
but within 10 statute miles is also reported as in the
vicinity, “VC.” Phenomena beyond 10 statute miles
will be shown as distant, “DSNT.” Distances are in
statute miles except for automated lightning remarks
which are in nautical miles. Movement of clouds or
weather will be indicated by the direction toward
which the phenomena is moving.

at a manual location, the frequency and location is
reported.
When cloud-to-ground lightning is detected by an
automated lightning detection system, such as
ALDARS:
[a] Within 5 nautical miles (NM) of the
Airport Reference Point (ARP), it will be reported as
“TS” in the body of the report with no remark;
[b] Between 5 and 10 NM of the ARP, it
will be reported as “VCTS” in the body of the report
with no remark;
[c] Beyond 10 but less than 30 NM of the
ARP, it will be reported in remarks as “DSNT”
followed by the direction from the ARP.

c. Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). A concise statement of the expected meteorological conditions at an
airport during a specified period. At most locations,
TAFs have a 24 hour forecast period. However, TAFs
for some locations have a 30 hour forecast period.
These forecast periods may be shorter in the case of
an amended TAF. TAFs use the same codes as
METAR weather reports. They are scheduled four
times daily for 24-hour periods beginning at 0000Z,
0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z.
Forecast times in the TAF are depicted in two ways.
The first is a 6-digit number to indicate a specific
point in time, consisting of a two-digit date,
two-digit hour, and two-digit minute (such as
issuance time or FM). The second is a pair of
four-digit numbers separated by a “/” to indicate a
beginning and end for a period of time. In this case,
each four-digit pair consists of a two-digit date and
a two-digit hour.
TAFs are issued in the following format:
TYPE OF REPORT/ICAO STATION IDENTIFIER/
DATE AND TIME OF ORIGIN/VALID PERIOD
DATE AND TIME/FORECAST METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
NOTE-
The “/” above and in the following descriptions are for
separation purposes in this publication and do not appear
in the actual TAFs.

14008KT 5SM BR BKN030 = forecast meteorological conditions
Explanation of TAF elements:

Meteorology

1. Type of Report. There are two types of TAF
issuances, a routine forecast issuance (TAF) and an
amended forecast (TAF AMD). An amended TAF is
issued when the current TAF no longer adequately
describes the on-going weather or the forecaster feels
the TAF is not representative of the current or
expected weather. Corrected (COR) or delayed
(RTD) TAFs are identified only in the communications header which precedes the actual forecasts.
2. ICAO Station Identifier. The TAF code
uses ICAO 4-letter location identifiers as described
in the METAR section.
3. Date and Time of Origin. This element is
the date and time the forecast is actually prepared.
The format is a two-digit date and four-digit time
followed, without a space, by the letter “Z.”
4. Valid Period Date and Time. The UTC
valid period of the forecast consists of two four-digit
sets, separated by a “/”. The first four-digit set is a
two-digit date followed by the two-digit beginning
hour, and the second four-digit set is a two-digit date
followed by the two-digit ending hour. Although
most airports have a 24-hour TAF, a select number of
airports have a 30-hour TAF. In the case of an
amended forecast, or a forecast which is corrected or
delayed, the valid period may be for less than 24
hours. Where an airport or terminal operates on a
part-time basis (less than 24 hours/day), the TAFs
issued for those locations will have the abbreviated
statement “AMD NOT SKED” added to the end of
the forecasts. The time observations are scheduled to
end and/or resume will be indicated by expanding the
AMD NOT SKED statement. Expanded statements
will include:
(a) Observation ending time (AFT DDHHmm; for example, AFT 120200)
(b) Scheduled observations resumption time
(TIL DDHHmm; for example, TIL 171200Z) or
(c) Period of observation unavailability
(DDHH/DDHH); for example, 2502/2512).
5. Forecast Meteorological Conditions. This
is the body of the TAF. The basic format is:
W I N D / V I S I B I L I T Y / W E AT H E R / S K Y
CONDITION/OPTIONAL DATA (WIND SHEAR)
The wind, visibility, and sky condition elements are
always included in the initial time group of the
forecast. Weather is included only if significant to

Meteorology


aviation. If a significant, lasting change in any of the
elements is expected during the valid period, a new
time period with the changes is included. It should be
noted that with the exception of a “FM” group the
new time period will include only those elements
which are expected to change, i.e., if a lowering of the
visibility is expected but the wind is expected to
remain the same, the new time period reflecting the
lower visibility would not include a forecast wind.
The forecast wind would remain the same as in the
previous time period. Any temporary conditions
expected during a specific time period are included
with that time period. The following describes the
elements in the above format.
(a) Wind. This five (or six) digit group
includes the expected wind direction (first 3 digits)
and speed (last 2 digits or 3 digits if 100 knots or
greater). The contraction “KT” follows to denote the
units of wind speed. Wind gusts are noted by the letter
“G” appended to the wind speed followed by the
highest expected gust. A variable wind direction is
noted by “VRB” where the three digit direction
usually appears. A calm wind (3 knots or less) is
forecast as “00000KT.”
EXAMPLE-
18010KT . . . . . wind one eight zero at one zero (wind is
blowing from 180).
35012G20KT . . wind three five zero at one two gust two
zero.

(b) Visibility. The expected prevailing visibility up to and including 6 miles is forecast in statute
miles, including fractions of miles, followed by “SM”
to note the units of measure. Expected visibilities
greater than 6 miles are forecast as P6SM (plus
six statute miles).
EXAMPLE-
1/ SM - visibility one-half
2
4SM - visibility four
P6SM - visibility more than six

(c) Weather Phenomena. The expected
weather phenomena is coded in TAF reports using the
same format, qualifiers, and phenomena contractions
as METAR reports (except UP). Obscurations to
vision will be forecast whenever the prevailing
visibility is forecast to be 6 statute miles or less. If no
significant weather is expected to occur during a
specific time period in the forecast, the weather
phenomena group is omitted for that time period. If,
after a time period in which significant weather
phenomena has been forecast, a change to a forecast

7-1-69

of no significant weather phenomena occurs, the
contraction NSW (No Significant Weather) will
appear as the weather group in the new time period.
(NSW is included only in TEMPO groups).
NOTE-
It is very important that pilots understand that NSW only
refers to weather phenomena, i.e., rain, snow, drizzle, etc.
Omitted conditions, such as sky conditions, visibility,
winds, etc., are carried over from the previous time group.

(d) Sky Condition. TAF sky condition
forecasts use the METAR format described in the
METAR section. Cumulonimbus clouds (CB) are the
only cloud type forecast in TAFs. When clear skies
are forecast, the contraction “SKC” will always be
used. The contraction “CLR” is never used in the
TAF. When the sky is obscured due to a
surface-based phenomenon, vertical visibility (VV)
into the obscuration is forecast. The format for
vertical visibility is “VV” followed by a three-digit
height in hundreds of feet.
NOTE-
As in METAR, ceiling layers are not designated in the TAF
code. For aviation purposes, the ceiling is the lowest
broken or overcast layer or vertical visibility into a
complete obscuration.

SKC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . “sky clear”
SCT005 BKN025CB . “five hundred scattered,
ceiling two thousand
five hundred broken
cumulonimbus clouds”
VV008 . . . . . . . . . . . . “indefinite ceiling
eight hundred”
(e) Optional Data (Wind Shear). Wind
shear is the forecast of nonconvective low level winds
(up to 2,000 feet). The forecast includes the letters
“WS” followed by the height of the wind shear, the
wind direction and wind speed at the indicated height
and the ending letters “KT” (knots). Height is given
in hundreds of feet (AGL) up to and including
2,000 feet. Wind shear is encoded with the
contraction “WS,” followed by a three-digit height,
slant character “/,” and winds at the height indicated
in the same format as surface winds. The wind shear
element is omitted if not expected to occur.
WS010/18040KT - “LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR
AT ONE THOUSAND, WIND ONE EIGHT ZERO
AT FOUR ZERO”
d. Probability Forecast. The probability or
chance of thunderstorms or other precipitation events

7-1-70


occurring, along with associated weather conditions
(wind, visibility, and sky conditions). The PROB30
group is used when the occurrence of thunderstorms
or precipitation is 30-39% and the PROB40 group is
used when the occurrence of thunderstorms or
precipitation is 40-49%. This is followed by two
four-digit groups separated by a “/”, giving the
beginning date and hour, and the ending date and hour
of the time period during which the thunderstorms or
precipitation are expected.
NOTE-
NWS does not use PROB 40 in the TAF. However U.S.
Military generated TAFS may include PROB40. PROB30
will not be shown during the first nine hours of a NWS
forecast.
EXAMPLE-
PROB40 2221/2302 1/2 SM +TSRA “chance between
2100Z and 0200Z of
visibility one-half
statute mile in
thunderstorms and
heavy rain.”
PROB30 3010/3014 1SM RASN . “chance between
1000Z and 1400Z of
visibility one statute
mile in mixed rain
and snow.”

e. Forecast Change Indicators. The following
change indicators are used when either a rapid,
gradual, or temporary change is expected in some or
all of the forecast meteorological conditions. Each
change indicator marks a time group within the TAF
report.
1. From (FM) group. The FM group is used
when a rapid change, usually occurring in less than
one hour, in prevailing conditions is expected.
Typically, a rapid change of prevailing conditions to
more or less a completely new set of prevailing
conditions is associated with a synoptic feature
passing through the terminal area (cold or warm
frontal passage). Appended to the “FM” indicator is
the six-digit date, hour, and minute the change is
expected to begin and continues until the next change
group or until the end of the current forecast. A “FM”
group will mark the beginning of a new line in a TAF
report (indented 5 spaces). Each “FM” group
contains all the required elements-wind, visibility,
weather, and sky condition. Weather will be omitted
in “FM” groups when it is not significant to aviation.
FM groups will not include the contraction NSW.

Meteorology

EXAMPLE-
FM210100 14010KT P6SM SKC - “after 0100Z on the
21st, wind one four zero at one zero, visibility more than six,
sky clear.”

2. Becoming (BECMG) group. The BECMG
group is used when a gradual change in conditions is
expected over a longer time period, usually two
hours. The time period when the change is expected
is two four-digit groups separated by a “/”, with the
beginning date and hour, and ending date and hour of
the change period which follows the BECMG
indicator. The gradual change will occur at an
unspecified time within this time period. Only the
changing forecast meteorological conditions are
included in BECMG groups. The omitted conditions
are carried over from the previous time group.
NOTE-
The NWS does not use BECMG in the TAF.
EXAMPLE-
OVC012 BECMG 0114/0116 BKN020 - “ceiling one
thousand two hundred overcast. Then a gradual change
to ceiling two thousand broken between 1400Z on the 1st
and 1600Z on the 1st.”

Meteorology


3. Temporary (TEMPO) group. The TEMPO
group is used for any conditions in wind, visibility,
weather, or sky condition which are expected to last
for generally less than an hour at a time (occasional),
and are expected to occur during less than half the
time period. The TEMPO indicator is followed by
two four-digit groups separated by a “/”. The first
four digit group gives the beginning date and hour,
and the second four digit group gives the ending date
and hour of the time period during which the
temporary conditions are expected. Only the
changing forecast meteorological conditions are
included in TEMPO groups. The omitted conditions
are carried over from the previous time group.
EXAMPLE-
1. SCT030 TEMPO 0519/0523 BKN030 - “three
thousand scattered with occasional ceilings three thousand
broken between 1900Z on the 5th and 2300Z on the 5th.”
2. 4SM HZ TEMPO 1900/1906 2SM BR HZ - “visibility
four in haze with occasional visibility two in mist and haze
between 0000Z on the 19th and 0600Z on the 19th.”
